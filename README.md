What is Pure Data?
------------------

Pure Data is an open source graphical patching environment for audio and multimedia similar to [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/). It was created by [Miller Puckette](http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/) (who also created Max) in 1996 and is now a community project with contributors from around the world.

It's website is http://puredata.info and you can download it from http://puredata.info/downloads

There are a few versions of Pure Data ("Pd" for short) floating around, so it's good to know the distinctions between them:

* [Pd-vanilla](http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html): the core version by Miller Puckette
* [Pd-extended](http://puredata.info/downloads): the community version with additional libraries and functionality (this is the one most people use)
* [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd): the Pd-vanilla DSP core in an embeddable C library (so developers can run Pd patches *inside* their own apps)

What do I use it for?

Where do I start?
-----------------

Well, you can clone or download a zip of this repository and start looking into the example patches, but I'd recommend you "Read the Manual" first:

See [Pure Data Start Here](http://puredata.info/docs/StartHere)

There are also a few books online, see [Pure Data Book About Pd](http://puredata.info/docs/BooksAboutPd)
